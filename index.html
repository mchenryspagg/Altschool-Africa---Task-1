      <i>"The ability to learn is not fixed, it can change with effort".</i>
    <p> My goal for the Altschool diploma course is to gain the requisite skillset that will propel me in my journey to becoming a world class developer.
        I intend to become skilled in frontend development tools and be ready to compete on 
        a global stage by the end of December 2022. I also intend to learn and master the python programming 
        language and add that to my skillset.
        The goal is to earn my Altschool certificate with numerous programs completed 
        during the period that would help boast my portfolio for and subsequently get an internship or a remote job
